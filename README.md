If you think it would be *cute* to align all
the equals signs in your code, if you spend time configuring your window
manager or editor, if you put unicode check marks in your test runner,
if you add unnecessary hierarchies in your code directories, if you are
doing anything beyond just solving the problem - you don't understand
how ****ed the whole thing is. No one gives a **** about the glib object model.
