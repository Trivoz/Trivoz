I'm a "software developer" working on various projects. I am studying software engineering full-time at university and in my free time I like to do game jams, and mess around with typesetting and maths.
You can expect a very random publishing schedule regarding this blog, as I am unfortunately a very disorganised person - something I try to work on. I talk about whatever is on my mind, and if you think
what I write might be something you're interested in then feel free to stick around :)
